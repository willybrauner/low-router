`LowRouter` is a lightweight _(~=1.8Kb)_, low-level router implementation designed for use in nodejs, javascript or typescript applications. By default, `LowRouter` has no link with the browser history, but this repository provide a `createBrowserHistory` util ready to use. It also includes a `createMatcher` function to convert a route path to a regular expression, but still open to use a custom one.

This package contains:

- [@wbe/low-router](https://github.com/willybrauner/low-router/tree/main/packages/low-router) - low-router core vanilla
- [@wbe/low-router-preact](https://github.com/willybrauner/low-router/tree/main/packages/low-router-preact) - low-router wrapper for preact
